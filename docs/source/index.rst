------------------------------------
Welcome to OpenPile's documentation!
------------------------------------

This package is an open source python library that provides a toolbox for beam/pile calculations. It provides users with various objects to represent structural and geotechnical problems (such as piles, soil profiles, soil layers), 
and an assortment of routines for fast operations, including solving 1D FE beam models with or without Winkler approach.

Few features at a glance:

* Finite Element calculations with 1D Beam elements (following Euler-Bernoulli or Timishenko beam theories) to compute forces, deformations
* Winkler's approach of a beam supported by linear or non-linear springs
* Soil springs over axial, lateral and rotational degrees of freedoms
* Common soil spring formulations to model soil structure interaction with the structure (a beam or pile)

More details on how to use the library can be found in :ref:`usage`

.. important::
  This library supports the following versions of python: 3.8-3.10. 
  Python 3.11+ is not supported as one dependency of OpenPile (namely Numba) does not currently support Python 3.11+.
