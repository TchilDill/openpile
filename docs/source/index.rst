------------------------------------
Welcome to openpile's documentation!
------------------------------------

This package is an open source python library that provides users a toolbox for geotechnical pile
calculations.

This package allows the user to:

* Use basic Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (as well as Timoshenko's variation) to compute 
  forces, deflection of a beam (or a pile) under adequate loading and 
  support conditions.
* Use Winkler's approach of a beam (or a pile) supported by linear or non-linear lateral and/or 
  rotational springs to compute forces and deflection of the pile based on recognised 
  soil models such as the widely used traditional API models for sand and clay or more recent models that stem from 
  the PISA joint-industry project.

This library supports the following versions of python: 3.7-3.10. 
Python 3.11 is not supported!
