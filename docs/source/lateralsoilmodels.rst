.. _API-lat-sand:

API sand
--------

The API sand soil model is based on the publication by 
O'neill and Murchison, preceded by work from Reese, L.C. and others (
see [MuOn83]_ and [MuOn84]_). 

OpenPile's use of this model is done by calling the following class in a layer:

* :py:class:`openpile.soilmodels.API_sand`

This soil model provides soil springs as given by the function(s):

* :py:func:`openpile.utils.py_curves.api_sand`


p-y formulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API sand formulation is presented in both the API and DNVGL standards,
see, [DNV-RP-C212]_ and [API2000]_.

Granular soils are modelled by the sand p-y model as described 
with the following backbone formula:

.. math::

    p = A \cdot P_{max} \cdot \tanh \left( \frac{k \cdot X}{A \cdot P_{max} }  y \right) 

where:

* :math:`A` is a factor to account for static of cyclic loading 
* :math:`P_{max}` is the ultimate resistance of the p-y curve 
* :math:`k` is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction
* :math:`X` is the depth below mudline of the p-y curve.

Factor A
^^^^^^^^

The factor A takes into account whether the curve represent 
static(also called monotonic) or cycling loading and is equal to:

.. math::

    A = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \begin{split}
    0.9 & \text{  for cyclic loading} \\ 
    \\
    3 - 0.8 \frac{X}{D} \ge 0.9 & \text{  for static loading}
        \end{split}
      \end{cases}

where:

* :math:`D` is the pile diameter. 
 
Initial subgrade reaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The factor k is the initial modulus of subgrade reaction, which can be 
approximated by the following equation in which the output is given in kN/m³ 
and where :math:`\phi` is inserted in degrees: 

.. math::

    k = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \begin{split}
    197.8 \cdot \phi^2 - 10232 \cdot \phi + 136820 \ge 5400 & \text{ ,  below water table} \\ 
    \\
    215.3 \cdot \phi^2 - 8232 \cdot \phi + 63657 \ge 5400  & \text{ ,  above water table}
    \end{split}
    \end{cases}

The equation is a fit to the recommended values in [DNV-RP-C212]_.  The correspondence 
of this fit is illustrated in below figure:

.. figure:: /_static/py_API_sand/k_vs_phi.jpg
    :width: 80%

    Subgrade reaction moduli fits calculated by openpile.


Ultimate resistance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ultimate resistance :math:`P_{max}` is calculated via the coefficients C1, C2 and C3 found 
in the below figure. 

.. figure:: _static/py_API_sand/C_coeffs_graph.jpg
    :width: 80%

    Coefficients to calculate the maximum resistance. (as given in [MuOn84]_) 

The Ultimate resistance is found via the below equation:

.. math::

    P_{max} = \left( 
         C1 \cdot \sigma^{\prime} \cdot X + C2 \cdot \sigma^{\prime} \cdot D \right) \lt
         C3 \cdot \sigma^{\prime} \cdot D 

where:

* :math:`\sigma^{\prime}` is the vertical effective stress

.. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
.. _API-lat-clay:

API clay
--------

The lateral soil model called API clay is based on the work conducted by Matlock (1970) (see [Matl70]_).  

OpenPile's use of this model is done by calling the following class in a layer:

* :py:class:`openpile.soilmodels.API_clay`

This soil model provides soil springs as given by the function(s):

* :py:func:`openpile.utils.py_curves.api_clay`

The p-y clay formulation is presented in both the API and DNVGL standards,
see [DNV-RP-C212]_ and [API2000]_. 


.. note::
    From an undrained shear strength of 96 kPa (assumed as the threshold at which a clay is considered stiff), 
    the formulations are adjusted to account for a more brittle fracture and degradation 
    of the soil, and the *"modified Matlock approach"* is used, see [BaCA06]_.

    This value of 96 kPa can be changed by the user via the argument `stiff_clay_threshold`.
    Hence, if one would not want to include the *"modified Matlock approach"*, 
    one could simply increase this threshold to a very large value.

Ultimate resistance 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The utlimate resistance is calculated via the capacity of two failure mechanisms,
one that is shallow (wedge-type failure) and another that is deep (flow-around failure).

.. math::

    P_{max} &= min(P_{shallow}, P_{deep})
    \\\\
    P_{shallow} &= D (3 S_u + \sigma^{\prime}) + J \cdot S_u \cdot X
    \\\\
    P_{deep} &=  9 \cdot S_u \cdot D

where: 

* :math:`S_u` is the undrained shear strßength in Unconfined and 
  unconsolidated (UU) Trixial tests.
* :math:`\sigma^{\prime}` is the vertical effective stress.
* :math:`J` is an empirical factor determined by Matlock to fit results 
  to pile load tests. This value can vary from 0.25 to 0.50 depending on 
  the clay characteristics
* :math:`X` is the depth below ground level


Strain normalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A normalization parameter :math:`y_{50}` is used to scale the curve with respect
to the structure's scale.

.. math::

    y_{50} = 2.5 \cdot \varepsilon_{50} \cdot D

where: 

* :math:`D` is the pile width or diameter
* :math:`\varepsilon_{50}` is the strain at 50% ultimate resistance
  in Unconfined and unconsolidated (UU) Trixial tests.

Transition zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The transition zone corresponds to the depth at which the failure 
around the pile is not governed by the free-field boundary, i.e. the ground level.
Below the transition zone, a flow-around type of failure.

The transition zone is defined by the following formula:

.. math::

    X_R = \left( \frac{6 \cdot D}{\gamma^{\prime} \cdot \frac{D}{S_u} + J} \right) \ge  2.5 \cdot D

Initial stiffness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial slope :math:`k_{ini}` is calculated as per [DNV-RP-C212]_:  

.. math::

    k_{ini} = \dfrac{0.23 P_{max}}{0.1 y_{50}}

p-y formulation (static loading, Neq = 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Soft cohesive soils are modelled by the soft clay p-y model, 
generated using the following formula for static loading: 

.. math::

    p = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \begin{split}
    0.5 \cdot P_{max} \left( \frac{y}{y_{50}} \right)^{0.33} & \text{  for } y \le 8 y_{50} \\ 
    \\
    P_{max} & \text{  for } y \gt 8 y_{50}
    \end{split}
    \end{cases}  

p-y formulation (cyclic loading, Neq > 1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For cyclic loading and curves below the transition zone ( i.e. :math:`X \ge Xr`), 
the p-y curve can be generated according to: 

.. math::

    p = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \begin{split}
    0.5 \cdot P_{max} \left( \frac{y}{y_{50}} \right)^{0.33} & \text{  for } y \le 3 y_{50} \\ 
    \\
    0.72 \cdot P_{max} & \text{  for } y \gt 3 y_{50}
    \end{split}
    \end{cases}  

For cyclic loading and curves above the transition zone ( i.e. :math:`X \le Xr`), 
the p-y curve can be generated according to: 

.. math::

    p = 
    \begin{cases} 
    \begin{split}
    0.5 \cdot P_{max} \left( \frac{y}{y_{50}} \right) & \text{  for } y \le 3 y_{50} \\ 
    \\
    0.72 \cdot P_{max} \left[ 1 - \left( 1 - \frac{X}{X_R} \right) \left( \frac{y - 3 y_{50}}{12 y_{50}} \right)  \right] & \text{  for } 3 y_{50} \lt y \le 15 y_{50} \\
    \\
    0.72 \cdot P_{max} \left( \frac{X}{X_R} \right) & \text{  for } y \gt 15 y_{50} \\
    \end{split}
    \end{cases}  


.. _Dunkirk-sand:

Dunkirk-sand (PISA model)
-------------------------

OpenPile's use of this model is done by calling the following class in a layer:

* :py:class:`openpile.soilmodels.Dunkirk_sand`

This soil model provides soil springs as given by the function(s):

* :py:func:`openpile.utils.py_curves.dunkirk_sand`
* :py:func:`openpile.utils.mt_curves.dunkirk_sand`
* :py:func:`openpile.utils.Hb_curves.dunkirk_sand`
* :py:func:`openpile.utils.Mb_curves.dunkirk_sand`

.. note::
    This standard model only account for monotonic reaction curves and as usual, it reflects the site conditions of the site the curves were calibrated from, a site in Dunkirk, France where dense sand is found. 
    More details can be found in [BTZA20]_.

This soil model was formulated as part of the Joint Industry Project PISA, that focused on formulating soil springs for large diameter monopiles as found in the offshore wind industry. 
This resulted in soil springs formulated in a normalized space based on a conic function backbone curve and the few following soil parameters, 
(i) relative density and (ii) small-strain shear stiffness. 

Validation is shown in the below figure by performing a benchmark of OpenPile
against the source material, [BTZA20]_. OpenPile shows some differences in result for high lateral load. 
This is due to the lack of clearer guidance for the use of small-strain shear stiffness in calculations found in the source material.

.. _Reese-weakrock:

Reese weak rock 
---------------

OpenPile's use of this model is done by calling the following class in a layer:

* :py:class:`openpile.soilmodels.Reese_weakrock`

This soil model provides soil springs as given by the function(s):

* :py:func:`openpile.utils.py_curves.reese_weakrock`

* :py:func:`openpile.utils.Mb_curves.reese_weakrock`

This soil model is based on [Rees97]_ and can be used for rock. 
This empirical model is mostly based on experimental data of pile load tests near San Francisco
where the rock unconfined compressive strength varies from 1.86 MPa near the surface to 16.0 MPa.

Pressuremeter tests results were used by Reese in this formulation as the initial modulus of the rock.
